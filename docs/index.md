## What This Plugin Does

The Zotero Nanopublication Plugin bridges the gap between traditional research management and the semantic web by enabling researchers to:

!!! tip "Key Benefits"

    - **🔗 Connect** your Zotero library to the nanopublication ecosystem
    - **📝 Create** semantic statements from PDF annotations
    - **🔍 Discover** related nanopublications from other researchers  
    - **🤝 Collaborate** through machine-readable research claims

## Quick Overview

=== "For Readers"

    Transform your reading notes into structured, citable statements that contribute to the global knowledge graph.

=== "For Reviewers"

    Create semantic reviews and evaluations that other researchers can discover and build upon.

=== "For Collaborators"

    Share structured research insights that integrate seamlessly across research teams.

## Latest Features

## What are Nanopublications?

!!! question "New to Nanopublications?"

    Nanopublications are the smallest possible units of publishable information that represent scientific knowledge in a machine-readable format. They consist of:
    
    - **Assertion**: The core scientific claim or statement
    - **Provenance**: Information about how the assertion was made  
    - **Publication Info**: Metadata about the nanopublication itself
    
    This plugin helps researchers create nanopublications from their reading workflow, making their insights part of the broader semantic web of scientific knowledge.
