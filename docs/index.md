## What This Plugin Does

The Zotero Nanopublication Plugin brings semantic web publishing **directly into Zotero** - no external websites, no context switching.

!!! tip "Key Benefits"

    - **All In-Zotero** - Create nanopubs without leaving your workspace
    - **Embedded Forms** - Smart forms generated from templates, rendered in Zotero tabs
    - **Discover** - Find related nanopublications from other researchers
    - **FAIR Principles** - Contribute to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable science
    - **ORCID Signed** - Cryptographically sign your work for proper attribution

---

## Quick Overview

=== "For Readers"

    **Annotate your readings semantically.**  
    Transform reading notes into structured, citable statements. Create nanopubs about papers as you read them - all in Zotero.

=== "For Reviewers"

    **Write machine-readable reviews.**  
    Use CiTO (Citation Typing Ontology) to describe paper relationships. Others can discover and build upon your evaluations.

=== "For Researchers"

    **Publish semantic claims.**  
    Make formal research assertions with AIDA templates. Your claims become part of the global knowledge graph, signed with your ORCID.

## What are Nanopublications?

!!! question "New to Nanopublications?"

    Nanopublications are the smallest units of publishable information in machine-readable format:
    
    - **Assertion** - The core claim or statement
    - **Provenance** - Who made it, when, and how
    - **Publication Info** - Metadata about the nanopub itself
    
    This plugin helps you create nanopublications from your Zotero workflow, making your insights part of the semantic web of scientific knowledge.
