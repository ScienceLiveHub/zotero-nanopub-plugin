- DOI or URI
- Title and citation information
- Pre-filled from your selected Zotero item

**Example:** `https://doi.org/10.1234/example.2024`

---

#### **2. Location Identifier** (required)
A unique identifier for the geographical area:
- Creates a URI for the location
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Should be descriptive and memorable

**Examples:**
- `amazon-basin`
- `langhe-region-italy`

- "Mediterranean Basin"

---

#### **4. Geometry Details (WKT format)** (optional, collapsible)

For precise spatial definitions, you can provide geometry coordinates:

**Geometry Identifier:**
- Identifier for the geometry object
- Auto-filled as `{location-id}-geometry`
- Example: `langhe-region-italy-geometry`

**WKT Coordinates:**
- Well-Known Text format
- Enables spatial queries
- Supports points, lines, and polygons

**WKT Format Examples:**

**Point (single location):**
```
POINT(2.3522 48.8566)
```
‚Üë Coordinates for Paris (longitude, latitude)

**Polygon (area boundary):**
```
POLYGON((7.5 44.3, 8.5 44.3, 8.5 44.9, 7.5 44.9, 7.5 44.3))
```
‚Üë Rectangular boundary (longitude/latitude pairs, first point repeated at end)

**Line (route or transect):**
```
LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1, 2 2)
```

**üí° Resources:**
- [WKT on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)

   - (Optional) Click to expand geometry section:
     - **Geometry ID:** Auto-filled as `langhe-region-italy-geometry`
     - **WKT:** `POLYGON((7.5 44.3, 8.5 44.3, 8.5 44.9, 7.5 44.9, 7.5 44.3))`
5. Click "Create & Publish"

**Result:** A machine-readable nanopublication stating:
> Paper [DOI] covers the geographical area "Langhe region, Italy" with precise coordinates

---

### Why Add Geometry?

**Without geometry:**
- Location is referenced by name only
- Text-based search only
- No spatial queries possible

**With geometry (WKT):**
- Enables spatial queries: "Show all research within 50km of this point"
- GIS integration: Import into mapping software
- Precise boundaries: Exact area definition
- Overlap detection: Find studies covering the same region
- Map visualization: Display on interactive maps

---

### Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ **DO:**

**Be specific enough:**
- ‚úÖ "Amazon Basin, Brazil" (specific region)
- ‚ùå "South America" (too broad, unless that's the actual scope)

**Use consistent naming:**
- Follow standard geographical names
- Include country/context when needed
- Use English names for broader discoverability

**Provide geometry when precision matters:**
- Environmental studies: exact sampling areas
- Climate research: precise regions
- Biodiversity: habitat boundaries

**Use appropriate geometry types:**
- Study site = POINT
- Survey transect = LINESTRING
- Study area = POLYGON

#### ‚ùå **DON'T:**

**Don't be too vague:**
- ‚ùå "Europe" (unless paper truly covers all of Europe)
- ‚ùå "The region" (which region?)

**Don't mix geometry types:**
- Use one geometry per nanopub
- Create multiple nanopubs for multiple distinct areas

**Don't guess coordinates:**
- Only add WKT if you have accurate data
- Leave optional if unsure

### Common Patterns

**Single Site Study:**
```
Location: field-station-costa-rica
Name: La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica
Geometry: POINT(-84.0 10.4)
```

**Regional Survey:**
```
Location: scandinavian-mountain-range
Name: Scandinavian Mountains
Geometry: POLYGON((complex coordinates))
```

**Multiple Sites:**
Create separate nanopubs for each distinct site, or use:
```
Location: mediterranean-sampling-sites
Name: Mediterranean Sea Sampling Network
Geometry: MULTIPOINT((2.3 43.3), (12.5 41.9), (23.7 37.9))
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**"I don't know the exact coordinates"**
- Leave geometry section collapsed (optional)
- The named location is still valuable

**"My study area is complex"**
- Use a bounding box (rectangle) as approximation
- Or use geojson.io to trace the boundary

**"Should I use country names?"**
- Yes, if the entire country is the study area
- Add context: "Northern Italy" not just "Italy" if more specific

**"What if location has multiple names?"**
- Use the most common English name
- Include local name in brackets: "Prague (Praha), Czech Republic"
