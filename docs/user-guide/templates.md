## Citation with CiTO

### What is CiTO?

CiTO (Citation Typing Ontology) provides structured ways to describe **why** you're citing a paper, not just **that** you cited it.

### When to Use
Use it if you do not need to add a personal comment e.g. when the options in the dropdown menu are sufficient to explain why you are citing this paper.

When you select this template, the form in Zotero includes:

**1. Article Being Cited** 

- DOI or URI
- Citation string

**2. Relationship Type** (dropdown)
Choose from CiTO relationships:

**Agreement & Support:**

- `agrees_with` - I agree with statements in this paper
- `confirms` - I confirm findings from this paper
- `supports` - I provide supporting evidence

**Extension & Building:**

- `extends` - I extend ideas from this paper
- `updates` - I update information in this paper

**Critique:**

- `critiques` - I critique this paper
- `disagrees_with` - I disagree with this paper
- `disputes` - I dispute claims in this paper

**Methods & Data:**

- `uses_method_in` - I use methods from this paper
- `uses_data_from` - I use data from this paper

**Discussion:**

- `discusses` - I discuss this paper
- `reviews` - I review this paper

### Example Workflow

**Scenario:** You read a paper and agrees with it

1. Select paper in Zotero: "Heat-related mortality amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic"
2. Right-click → Create Nanopublication → 📝 Citation with CiTO
3. Form opens with paper DOI pre-filled

- "Great Barrier Reef, Australia"
- "Arctic Circle"
- "Mediterranean Basin"

---

#### **4. Geometry Details (WKT format)** (optional, collapsible)

For precise spatial definitions, you can provide geometry coordinates:

**Geometry Identifier:**

- Identifier for the geometry object
- Auto-filled as `{location-id}-geometry`
- Example: `langhe-region-italy-geometry`

**WKT Coordinates:**

- Well-Known Text format
- Enables spatial queries
- Supports points, lines, and polygons

**WKT Format Examples:**

**Point (single location):**
```
POINT(2.3522 48.8566)
```
↑ Coordinates for Paris (longitude, latitude)

**Polygon (area boundary):**
```
POLYGON((7.5 44.3, 8.5 44.3, 8.5 44.9, 7.5 44.9, 7.5 44.3))
```
↑ Rectangular boundary (longitude/latitude pairs, first point repeated at end)

**Line (route or transect):**
```
LINESTRING(0 0, 1 1, 2 2)
```

**💡 Resources:**
- [WKT on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry)

   - **Name:** `Langhe region, Italy`
   - (Optional) Click to expand geometry section:
     - **Geometry ID:** Auto-filled as `langhe-region-italy-geometry`
     - **WKT:** `POLYGON((7.5 44.3, 8.5 44.3, 8.5 44.9, 7.5 44.9, 7.5 44.3))`
5. Click "Create & Publish"

**Result:** A machine-readable nanopublication stating:
> Paper [DOI] covers the geographical area "Langhe region, Italy" with precise coordinates

---

### Why Add Geometry?

**Without geometry:**
- Location is referenced by name only
- Text-based search only
- No spatial queries possible

**With geometry (WKT):**
- Enables spatial queries: "Show all research within 50km of this point"
- GIS integration: Import into mapping software
- Precise boundaries: Exact area definition
- Overlap detection: Find studies covering the same region
- Map visualization: Display on interactive maps

---

### Best Practices

#### ✅ **DO:**

**Be specific enough:**
- ✅ "Amazon Basin, Brazil" (specific region)
- ❌ "South America" (too broad, unless that's the actual scope)

**Use consistent naming:**
- Follow standard geographical names
- Include country/context when needed
- Use English names for broader discoverability

**Provide geometry when precision matters:**
- Environmental studies: exact sampling areas
- Climate research: precise regions
- Biodiversity: habitat boundaries

**Use appropriate geometry types:**
- Study site = POINT
- Survey transect = LINESTRING
- Study area = POLYGON

#### ❌ **DON'T:**

**Don't be too vague:**
- ❌ "Europe" (unless paper truly covers all of Europe)
- ❌ "The region" (which region?)

**Don't mix geometry types:**
- Use one geometry per nanopub
- Create multiple nanopubs for multiple distinct areas

**Don't guess coordinates:**
- Only add WKT if you have accurate data
- Leave optional if unsure

---

### Technical Details

**Ontology:** Uses standard geographical vocabularies and GeoSPARQL

**Output Format:** RDF with spatial predicates

**Enables:**
- SPARQL spatial queries
- GIS software integration
- Location-based discovery

### Common Patterns

**Single Site Study:**
```
Location: field-station-costa-rica
Name: La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica
Geometry: POINT(-84.0 10.4)
```

**Regional Survey:**
```
Location: scandinavian-mountain-range
Name: Scandinavian Mountains
Geometry: POLYGON((complex coordinates))
```

**Multiple Sites:**
Create separate nanopubs for each distinct site, or use:
```
Location: mediterranean-sampling-sites
Name: Mediterranean Sea Sampling Network
Geometry: MULTIPOINT((2.3 43.3), (12.5 41.9), (23.7 37.9))
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**"I don't know the exact coordinates"**
- Leave geometry section collapsed (optional)
- The named location is still valuable

**"My study area is complex"**
- Use a bounding box (rectangle) as approximation
- Or use geojson.io to trace the boundary

**"Should I use country names?"**
- Yes, if the entire country is the study area
- Add context: "Northern Italy" not just "Italy" if more specific

**"What if location has multiple names?"**
- Use the most common English name
- Include local name in brackets: "Prague (Praha), Czech Republic"
